## Method

Combine the water, sugar and yeast by whisking with a fork. Set aside for 5 minutes - bubbles or foam should form on top.

Sift flour and salt into a bowl and make a well in the centre.

Add the yeast mixture and oil to the bowl of flour. Mix until mostly together and turn out onto a floured surface. Knead for 10 minutes.

Lightly brush a bowl with oil, place the dough in bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover and set to rise for 30-60 mins.

Lightly knead dough into a cylinder and divide into four sections. Press and stretch into a desirable size and thickness, cover with topping and cook.
