1. Bring water to the boil and add sugar. Stir to desolve.

2. Turn off the heat and stoop tea bags for 20 mins.

3. Remove tea bags and let liquid cool to room temperature

4. Add SCOBY and kombucha liquid - don't add to hot water as it will kill bacteria.

5. Cover with a tea towel and leave in a warm location for 10-14 days.

6. Remove SCOBY and a small amount of liquid for the next batch and separate into bottles for the second fermentation period. I like to add 2 teaspoons of grated ginger and some kind of crushed sweet fruit - such as blueberries.

7. Leave in a warm location to further ferment for 7 days.

8. Refrigerate and strain before drinking!
