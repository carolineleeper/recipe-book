Preheat oven to 150°C and slice roma tomatoes in half.

Combine onion, garlic and olive oil in a bowl and microwave for 30 seconds.

Add spices to the bowl and season with salt and pepper. Mix together and coat tomato halves by rotating through the mixture with hands. Place tomato halves on a baking tray and pour remaining mixture over.

Bake for 2 hours flipping once, and then a further 30 minutes at 200°C. Allow to cool slightly and process into a thick sauce.
